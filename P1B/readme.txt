Project 1B README file
================================================================

1. We had collaboration in setting up our tables â€” Yujing Zhang was responsible for creating the tables, while Hanjing Fang was responsible for the queries and violation part. For the php webpage, the two of us did pair - programming.

2. Our php webpage is an improved version of the demo: it is able to run all the complex queries and return error message if the input query is invalid, while the demo cannot run any subquery or query concerning selection on two or more tables.
