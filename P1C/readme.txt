Project 1c README file
================================================================

1.(IMPORTANT INFORMATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
Our webpage has a long header. You need to scroll down to the middle to see the main content every time you jump to a new webpage.

2. We split this project into two parts— Hanjing Fang was responsible for creating the four input pages and website design (including html, javascript and css). Yujing Zhang was responsible for the two browsing pages and one search page.

3. Our “Mooovie” website can implement all the required function well and looks beautiful since we did a lot work on javascript and css. We love it and hope you will enjoy the searching on it! :)
